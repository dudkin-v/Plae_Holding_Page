          <h2>About Plae</h2>
          <p>
            Previously a Designer for Puma and Adidas, Head Designer Ryan
            Ringholz has started a new revolution in kids trainers. Using
            technology usually reserved for elite athletes, Plae creates shoes
            designed especially for a childâ€™s foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because kids feet are always growing, their shoes should accommodate
            leaving the cartilage and fledgling bone room to grow its own way.
            The interchangeable tabs adjust to accommodate thinner, wider or
            thicker feet and nearly all Plae shoes can fit an AFO orthotic
            brace.
          </p>
          <p>
            With their dynamic traction, little feet can feel the ground beneath
            them and get a grip on it. The rest is designed to elite athlete
            standards: super shock absorption, durable toe guards, and wicking,
            washable anti-microbial inserts.
          </p>
          <p>
            With every shoe, Plae sources responsible, recycled, and non-toxic
            materials, and makes sure manufacturing and labour is fair and
            child-free.

            <p>
              I like them because they are very comfy and soft inside. They are
              really light which means I run faster. I like the cool straps that
              I can change

              I like that I can do PE in them because they're so comfy and then
              after school in the park, the bottoms are grippy so I can climb
              really well
